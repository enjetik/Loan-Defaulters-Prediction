# Loan-Defaulters-Prediction
To quantify risk factors in loan application process for firm. To predict loan applications that are likely to default and identify which factors influence this.

The primary goal of this project is to extract patterns from a common loan approved dataset, and then build a model based on these extracted patterns, to predict the likely loan defaulters by using classification data mining algorithms.The historical data of the customers like their annual income, FICO Scores, Interest rate, DTI etc. will be used as factors in developing an analysis. We intend to identify which are the key factors that determine a loan be approved or not.

Algorithms used are
